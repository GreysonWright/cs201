There is a conviction,
when you believe above,
absence leaks from inside,
and brings you back to life again,
I fear an emptiness,
so I just seek the truth,
then I just find myself,
coming back to you.
Lord please guide us through our struggles tonight,
let your presence be known here alongside of us throughout
this time,
let us know why we are here tonight,
it's for a purpose,
a certain reason,
allow our hearts to know that we are here because of our love for
the faith and what we do together as one, as well as for you lord,
Hebrews 11:6 "But without faith it is impossible to please him,
for he who comes to God must believe that he is,
and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him."
No greater love,
there is no greater love.
Lord bind our souls as one,
there is no greater love.
Let your presence be known.
Lord bind our souls as one,
there is no greater love.
Father I'm here to pray in your name,
please push me in the direction of what is best for me,
give me the strength to believe, trust, and forgive,
but more importantly father I need you to rid me of my
fears and sins,
my feelings and actions are not hidden from you,
I ask for forgiveness in my time of need,
so you can see me through to things that I need,
and that's love and happiness it's all I'll ever need,
and with you by my side it will never leave.
